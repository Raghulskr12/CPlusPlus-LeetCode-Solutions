/*
Intuition:
The task is to count how many numbers from 1 to `num` have an even sum of digits. We can iterate through each number, calculate the sum of its digits, and check whether the sum is even or not.

Approach:
1. Create a helper function `hasEvenDigitSum` that calculates the sum of digits of a number and checks if it's even.
2. In the `countEven` function, iterate through all numbers from 1 to `num` and count how many of them have an even digit sum by calling the helper function.

Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** O(n * d), where `n` is the input number, and `d` is the number of digits in each number. For each number, we calculate its digit sum.
- **Space complexity:** O(1) â€” Only a few integer variables are used, so space usage is constant.
